# Introduction
Yahboom Raspberry Pi 4WD Smart Robot is specially designed for educators, students, and Raspberry Pi enthusiasts. Most of the components are connected with screw, copper pillar and anti-reverse socket, which is the same as our other smart robots. The difference for our 4WD robot is that we use the latest Raspberry Pi 4B board as the core controller and HD camera with two degrees of freedom. Through the 5G WIFI network of Raspberry Pi, the real-time transmission of HD video can be realized. Coupled with the high-quality Bluetooth 4.0 module, so we can control car by Android/iOS mobile APP. In addition, we have created a series of AI visual gameplay based on OpenCV, such as face detection, color tracking, gesture recognition, object detection, etc. Users can not only learn about the robot car with our robot kit but study the Raspberry Pi 4B board included in this product separately. We can match it with a mouse and a keyboard to form a microcomputer, plus various sensor modules and communication modules so that you can create more possibilities.
